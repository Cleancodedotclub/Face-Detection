Python Face Detection is a GitHub repository that provides an implementation of face detection using the OpenCV library in Python. The repository includes code that can detect faces in real-time video streams, as well as images. The face detection algorithm used in the repository is the Haar Cascade classifier, which is a popular object detection algorithm. The repository also includes code for drawing bounding boxes around detected faces and labeling them. Additionally, there are several examples provided for integrating the face detection code into larger projects. This repository can be used as a starting point for projects that require facial detection and tracking, such as security systems, access control, and more.
